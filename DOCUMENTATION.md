# Lilly Technical Challenge Documentation Template

*This documentation template serves as a place for you to discuss how you approached this challenge, any issues you faced & how you overcame them, or any other points that you feel would be relevant for the interviewers to know. The text in italics is here to guide you - feel free to remove it once you fill out each section!*

***Not every section in this document is required. This is just a template to help get you started. Feel free to add or remove sections as you feel necessary.***

## Approach
*How did you approach this challenge? Did you work through the objectives in any particular order? If so, why? Did you utilize any external resources, such as tutorials, guides, or other materials?*
### 
Throughout the project, I followed an agile approach. 
I broke down the overall task into smaller, executable units and continuously built a system by adding new features gradually.
Each task was tracked as a GitHub issue. I created a new branch from each issue to clearly link tasks to their branches, making progress easy to manage.

The project was proceeded with the following steps.

1. Understanding the project goal and breaking down the small tasks
2. Creating wireframes 
3. Creating GitHub issues representing each task
4. Developing features one by one from each issue
5. Testing/reviewing completed work and creating additional issues for any missing or incomplete points

After understanding the project goals, I created wireframes using Figma.
Having a visual reference helped clarify the target outcome and reduced confusion later on.

To create the wireframes, I searched similar existing web services and followed their design patterns.
This made the UI more familiar and intuitive for users (users can predict how to use the system), improving usability and user experience.
I also tried to reflect Lilly's brand colour and fonts as much as possible.

Each GitHub issue included the same basic structure to ensure consistency and avoid missing any mandatory information.
I kept the content simple but clear enough to avoid unnecessary effort, but still clear enough to understand what needed to be developed.
This made it easier for the developer (myself) to stay on track and avoid confusion.

I created issues not only for the main tasks but also for any bugs or additional features that came up during development.

I decided the development order with the intention of completing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as early as possible.
For instance, styling and less critical parts were done later, so the system remained functional/executable throughout the process.

## Objectives - Innovative Solutions
*For the challenge objectives, did you do anything in a particular way that you want to discuss? Is there anything you're particularly proud of that you want to highlight? Did you attempt some objectives multiple times, or go back and re-write particular sections of code? If so, why? Use this space to document any key points you'd like to tell us about.*

## Problems Faced
*Use this space to document and discuss any issues you faced while undertaking this challenge and how you solved them. We recommend doing this proactively as you experience and resolve the issues - make sure you don't forget! (Screenshots are helpful, though not required)*.

## Evaluation
*How did you feel about the challenge overall? Did some parts go better than others? Did you run out of time? If you were to do this again, and were given more time, what would you do differently?*
